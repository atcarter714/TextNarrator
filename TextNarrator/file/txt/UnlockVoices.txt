#If all of your installed voices are not showing up in the app, it's because
#they are not enabled in the Windows Registry. For some reason, this happens
#with voices you add to Windows from Settings menu and they simply don't show
#up even though they are installed. The following PowerShell script will fix
#this and enable all voices on your machine. However, it appears to create some
#duplicates with "Desktop" at the end of their names which throw an exception
#when the app tries to select them. For now, I'm catching the exception and tell
#the user the voice is no good. But I want to figure out why this is happening
#and how we can change our PowerShell script to prevent this from happening in
#the first place.
